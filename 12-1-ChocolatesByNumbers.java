PROBLEM DESCRIPTION (Source: https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/12-euclidean_algorithm/chocolates_by_numbers/)
	Two positive integers N and M are given. Integer N represents the number of chocolates arranged in a circle, numbered from 0 to N âˆ’ 1.
	You start to eat the chocolates. After eating a chocolate you leave only a wrapper.
	You begin with eating chocolate number 0. Then you omit the next M âˆ’ 1 chocolates or wrappers on the circle, and eat the following one.
	More precisely, if you ate chocolate number X, then you will next eat the chocolate with number (X + M) modulo N (remainder of division).
	You stop eating when you encounter an empty wrapper.
	For example, given integers N = 10 and M = 4. You will eat the following chocolates: 0, 4, 8, 2, 6.
	The goal is to count the number of chocolates that you will eat, following the above rules.

	Write a function:
		class Solution { public int solution(int N, int M); }
	that, given two positive integers N and M, returns the number of chocolates that you will eat.
	For example, given integers N = 10 and M = 4. the function should return 5, as explained above.
	
	Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
		N and M are integers within the range [1..1,000,000,000].

class Solution {
    public int solution(int N, int M) {
        // write your code in Java SE 8
        
        int gcdValue = gcd(N, M, 1);
        
        if(gcdValue > 1){
            return (N / gcdValue);
        }else{
            // there is no Greatest Common Divisor between N and M.
            // All Chocolates area eaten
            return N;

    }
    
    // Given two numbers a and b (res = 1 first time it is call), returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
    // If there is not GCD returns 1.
